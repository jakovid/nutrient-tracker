# Micronutrient Tracker (Prototype)

A complete solution built using React, HTML, CSS, JS, Firebase, and the USDA FoodData Central API.

## Project Overview

**Objective:** Design and develop a rapid prototype web application within a two-week timeframe for a Taipei-based startup studio.

**Background:** The startup studio is dedicated to forging businesses and products centered on root cause analyses and functional health solutions. I was privileged to join the inaugural group of rapid prototype developers. Our objective was to ideate and fashion instrumental tools for evaluation. The initial week was dedicated to in-depth industry research and idea presentation, subsequently leading to an accelerated development sprint for product realization.

### Features

**For Users:**

- Comprehensive meal tracking capability.
- Database integration for real-time USDA food search and data.
- Personalized dashboard with detailed micronutrient breakdowns.
- Nutrient intake scoring algorithm tailored to user-specific biometrics and activity levels.
